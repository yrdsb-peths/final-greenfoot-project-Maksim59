# Final Greenfoot Project

Maksim Isayenka

GAME = ASTEROIDS



The project is basically a classic asteorids game. WASD to move and space to shoot. The asteroids split off when hit in 2 random directoins and the small astertoids are worth 5 points while the big asteroids are worth 10. Classic hearts animation and sound effects like popping, losing a life, shooting, and colliding with asteroids. Also theres a game over screen and a start screen with 2 buttons, a how to play button and a launch button. As well there is a highscore feature and the game gets progressivley harder because of the more asteroids added and because of the increasing speed of the asteroids. (as a quick tip, make sure you break the small asteroids first in the beginning as they are the fastest)

To get started simply click run and then the launch button. If you want to review the controls click on the "how to play button".
